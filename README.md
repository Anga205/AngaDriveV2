# AngaDriveV2

ðŸ”° This project is still in development, so self hosting instructions have not been released yet, although they will be, *soon*

## Tech stack
- Reflex (to transpile the frontend to a Next.js application)
- FastAPI (to quickly and efficiently serve CDN)
- SQLite (because it's relatively portable)
- Cloudflare tunnel api (because airtel doesnt like it when i do port forwarding)

## Hardware requirements
As of now, there arent any set-in-stone hardware requirements for this project, as long as your computer can run a PVM (python virtual environment), it will probably be able to run this, although, if you are curious about my hardware, heres a neofetch on the live server:

#### please note that by self hosting this app, you take full responsibility of anything that happens to your hard drive and you also agree that mogu mogu is the best fruit juice in the world.
